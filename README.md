# Revamp CDLI tablet apps (Apple and Android)

The project has been move to https://github.com/cdli-gh/cdli-mobile-app

CDLI tablet app offers a curated collection of images, text, and metadata of artifacts inscribed
with the cuneiform script. Artifacts from the ancient Near East, which document three millennia of
human activity, are made available to the users through this mobile application.

The idea of the Revamp CDLI tablet apps project is to recreate the existing CDLI tablet app using
Flutter and provide a web admin interface for the mobile app data entry and management. Besides its
existing components, the new mobile application will offer additional features for a
highly-customized UX. CDLI tablet app will be accessible for both Android and iOS devices.
